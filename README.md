# Description

This project was created to create, read, update, and delete data related to each employee straight from the command line. This program uses a MySQL database to store this information and data. Using the inquirer module from node.js, we prompt user for data on employees on their team. When the user chooses to view an option the corresponding table appears in command prompt using the console.table package.
